## Project Outline
As a child, my thought process for the future was in one line; finish my degree, do my service and get married but God loves doing this thing called “Sike! That’s mot my will” and I’m just dazed and lost. I think part of the reason why God doesn’t want me married or courted yet is I’m not ready yet. I’m still immature and have issues with a lot of stuffs and he don’t want that on another person’s head so He put it on halt for me (Not complaining though self-growth is a JOURNEY) So, how does it look to this 22-year-old girlie that she’s still single (My DXMs are dusty) and is looking at romance? Don’t bother scratching that all back on your head sis, I’m getting there.
